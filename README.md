# n8n
AI‑ready n8n workflows and custom nodes for dependable automation, combining a visual builder with code flexibility and self‑host or cloud deployment options. Concise enough for the repository description field while clearly stating purpose and value per README best‑practice guidance.
Overview
This repository hosts n8n workflows and optional custom nodes that use a visual canvas and optional JavaScript or Python to automate tasks and integrate services.
It emphasizes AI‑native automations and multi‑step agents while retaining the control and extensibility preferred by technical teams.
Both self‑hosted and managed-cloud usage patterns are supported to fit security and operational needs.

Features
Visual workflow builder with the option to write code in nodes for advanced logic or integrations.

AI‑native patterns for agents and data‑aware automations using popular frameworks and models where appropriate.

Hundreds of built‑in integrations plus ready‑to‑use templates to speed up common automations.

Flexible deployment with containerized setups and enterprise‑grade controls such as SSO and granular permissions.

What’s inside
This repo typically includes production‑ready workflows (.json), environment samples, and optional custom node packages for internal or community reuse.
Workflows aim for clarity, idempotence, and safe retries, while nodes focus on clean inputs, outputs, and minimal external assumptions.

Quick start
Import provided workflow files into an n8n instance and configure environment variables or credentials for connected services as indicated by each workflow’s notes.
For local development, run n8n in the preferred environment and enable version control support to track workflow changes safely.
Integrations with platforms like GitHub can be added or extended using dedicated n8n nodes for repository data and issue workflows.

Usage
Each workflow README block describes its trigger, expected inputs, side effects, and failure‑handling approach to support predictable operation.
When adapting templates, prefer parameterized credentials and environment keys to keep secrets out of version control and ease promotion across environments.

Development
Custom nodes can be scaffolded with the official starter, linted, and published as npm packages for reuse across multiple projects or teams.
Follow a conventional branching strategy and include minimal reproducible examples to validate node behavior and workflow contracts in reviews.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome via issues and pull requests that include context, test workflows, and rollback notes to simplify review and safe deployment.
Please keep README sections updated as features evolve so newcomers always have the latest instructions and compatibility notes.

License
This project references n8n’s fair‑code ecosystem and should include a clear license file indicating usage and redistribution terms for repository assets.
